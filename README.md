## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Guidelines:
- Work in branches and always ask for pull request after a rebase from the parent branch
- check the full working and minimize bugs before putting to production
- always maintain gitignore, no sensitive files to be uploaded like env or any auth realted files
